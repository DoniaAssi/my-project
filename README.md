The first thing I did was carefully study the reference design from Dribbble.
I broke the layout into main sections like:
Hero, Services, Testimonials, Footer, etc.
Then I took notes—what content goes into each section? Are there icons, images, animations?
Once the plan was clear, I started writing clean and organized HTML.
I made sure to use semantic elements like <section>, <nav>, <footer>, and added descriptive class names to each part.
This helped me keep everything modular and easy to style later.
I also added placeholder icons and images to match the design while building.

After that, I decided to work from top to bottom, building one section at a time.
Once the layout and styling were solid, I added animations to enhance the user experience.
I created utility classes like .fade-in and .delay-X to make elements appear gradually.
For the testimonial section, I implemented three progress bars:
The first bar runs for 3 seconds while showing the first slide.
When it finishes, the second bar starts and the second slide appears.
The third bar stays visible but doesn’t animate yet—just for visual balance.
